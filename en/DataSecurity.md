# eWeLink cloud data security FAQ

## What communication protocol does your smart hardware, server and application use?

We use TLS 1.2 secure connection mechanism, whether it is HTTP or WebSocket, we use HTTPS and WebSocket Secure protocols.

## Where is the eWeLink IoT cloud service hosted? Who is keeping our data?

eWeLink IoT cloud service is developed and operated by CoolKit Technology Co., Ltd, CoolKit Technology Co., Ltd is an advanced APN technology partner of Amazon Web Services (AWS). eWeLink IoT cloud services are all hosted in AWS data centers around the world. CoolKit has a professional team that regularly conducts security inspections on eWeLink IoT cloud services.

## How to ensure the stability and long-term operation of the eWeLink IoT cloud service?

Software: We have multiple data centers and server nodes around the world to ensure that services will not be interrupted. eWeLink has been in continuous operation for 5 years, and we are still growing. In this process, we are also continuously optimizing cloud platform services to provide users with a better product experience.

Hardware: The reliability certifications passed by cooperative chip manufacturers include HTOL, ESD-HM, MSL, μHAST and HTSL. Regarding the quality of hardware products, we require the hardware manufacturers we cooperate with to carry out rigorous stability tests on the hardware products, and the equipment can be sold after passing the tests.

_Note: Even if we stop operations due to force majeure, we are still able to build private cloud services for our partner vendors to ensure the normal use of users’ equipment, so you don’t have to worry about it._

## How to ensure the security of our user information?

Encrypted storage of user privacy information, encryption during communication, and full authentication/authentication mechanisms work together to ensure the security of our user information.

We strictly abide by the laws and regulations of the country and region where the user is located, such as GDPR. User data is safely stored in AWS data centers in the corresponding regions. Ensuring user information security is our highest priority in operating eWeLink IoT cloud services.

## Will my smart home device be hacked?

We guarantee that the device can only be controlled by the client authorized by the user, and the eWeLink platform will not issue any illegal device control instructions without authorization.

The device data is encrypted using international mainstream cryptographic algorithms. Due to irreversible encryption, it prevents cracking and reading and reduces the possibility of hacker attacks.

At the same time, we will continue to update the device's firmware and repair security issues, and add new device functions to improve device security.

## How to ensure the safety of camera products?

The cameras currently only support playback in the eWeLink app. They will perform two-way authentication when establishing a cloud connection, and the data transmission process is encrypted, so security can be guaranteed.

## Does CoolKit sign a confidentiality agreement with Amazon regarding platform user data?

Confidentiality agreement refers to an agreement between the parties to the agreement regarding written or oral information that one party informs the other party and stipulates that such information shall not be disclosed to any third party. CoolKit is a customer of AWS. Our cloud platform data is hosted on the AWS cloud. AWS has the responsibility and obligation to keep our data safe. There is no need to sign a confidentiality agreement. CoolKit has strictly followed the data privacy protection requirements officially stated by AWS, and manages platform data reasonably and legally. We have also taken reliable and complete technical and physical control measures with AWS to prevent users' content from being illegally accessed or disclosed.

## How to restrict user data from being made public?

First of all, CoolKit clearly stated the content of the privacy policy in the eWeLink official application. We will assist users to understand what information we collect, why we collect this information, and how users update, manage, export and delete their own information.

Secondly, the official application of eWeilink has passed the rigorous review of major domestic and foreign app stores, such as Tencent Privacy Authority Review Specification, Xiaomi App Store App Review Specification, Google Play Policy Review, App Store User Privacy Policy Review, etc.

Finally, we will encrypt and store user privacy information, and we will also have encryption, authentication and authentication throughout the communication process.

We strictly abide by the laws and regulations of the country and region where the user is located, such as GDPR (EU law "General Data Protection Regulation"). User data is safely stored in AWS data centers in the corresponding regions. Ensuring user information security is our highest priority in operating eWeLink IoT cloud services.

## How to be held accountable if data leaks?

The first is that when user information suffers an emergency, we will quickly repair, maintain or preserve it to reduce the risk of further leakage. Secondly, after ensuring that user data has not been leaked further, we will actively cooperate with the public security organs to investigate the facts, and after the judicial organs make a ruling, we will assume responsibilities in accordance with laws and regulations.
